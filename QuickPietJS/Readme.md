# QuickPietJS

This is a implementation of the QuickPiet language written entirely in Javascript to be run from index.html

Future enhancements will hopefully include
* Reading characters from STDIN should wait until a character is present
	(may need event structure rewrite and/or ability to pause operation at arbitrary command)
* Modify language to support out with argument (number of items to output)
* A better looking editor page
* Better error handling and error-line handling
* Ability to step through operations
* Ability to see the end and per-step stack values
* Ability to 'save' QuickPiet programs using HTML 5
