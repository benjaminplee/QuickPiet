__QuickPiet Language Spec__

QuickPiet is a language modeled to be a feature subset of the commands and control structures available to Piet programs (images).  
All QuickPiet operations should be able to be easily rendered within a Piet image: most are a one to one mapping.

The original spec documents can be found at the following [gist on GitHub](http://gist.github.com/332040).

The files in this repository are considered the new "authority" on QuickPiet with the old gist files being deprecated and not kept up to date.
